<h3>Project on Modification of Water Jacket on Roller Table in SMS-1, June 2023 - July 2023</h3>
The proposed modifications likely involve enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the water jacket system. This could include upgrading the cooling mechanism, optimizing water flow, improving insulation, or implementing automation for better control and monitoring.
<h2>Projects</h3>
<h3>Finite Element Analysis of Pelvis Response to Variable Loads and Fracture</h3>
The project aims to utilize Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate how the pelvis responds to varying loads and the potential for fracture. This research is crucial for understanding the biomechanics of the pelvis, particularly in scenarios involving accidents or trauma. By simulating different load conditions using FEA, the study seeks to provide insights into pelvis behavior, fracture mechanisms, and potential injury mitigation strategies. This research holds significance for fields such as biomechanical engineering, automotive safety, and medical science.
